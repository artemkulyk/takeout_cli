/// Calculates the distance between two geographical coordinates in meters,
/// and performs a speed check to filter out unrealistic movement.
///
/// This function uses the Haversine formula to compute the shortest distance
/// over the earthâ€™s surface between two latitude/longitude points. It also
/// calculates the speed based on the time difference between the two points
/// and filters out values where the speed exceeds 1200 km/h (interpreted as
/// potentially erroneous data).
///
/// Returns `null` if the calculated speed is above 1200 km/h, otherwise
/// returns the distance in meters.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - [lon1]: Longitude of the first point in decimal degrees.
/// - [lat1]: Latitude of the first point in decimal degrees.
/// - [lon2]: Longitude of the second point in decimal degrees.
/// - [lat2]: Latitude of the second point in decimal degrees.
/// - [time1]: Timestamp of the first point.
/// - [time2]: Timestamp of the second point.
///
/// Returns:
/// - `double?`: The distance in meters between the two points, or `null` if
///   the speed check fails.
